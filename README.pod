=head1 DESCRIPTION

Algorithm::LibLinear is an XS module that provides features of LIBLINEAR, a fast C library for classification and regression.

Current version is based on LIBLINEAR 2.48, released on January 5, 2025.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new([bias => -1.0] [, cost => 1] [, epsilon => 0.1] [, loss_sensitivity => 0.1] [, nu => 0.5] [, regularize_bias => 1] [, solver => 'L2R_L2LOSS_SVC_DUAL'] [, weights => []])

Constructor. You can set several named parameters:

=over 4

=item bias

Bias term to be added to prediction result (i.e., C<-B> option for LIBLINEAR's C<train> command.).

This parameter makes sense only when its value is positive.

=item cost

Penalty cost for misclassification (C<-c>.)

=item epsilon

Termination criterion (C<-e>.)

Default value of this parameter depends on the value of C<solver>.

=item loss_sensitivity

Epsilon in loss function of SVR (C<-p>.)

=item nu

Nu parameter of one-class SVM (C<-n>.)

=item regularize_bias

Whether to regularize the bias term (C<-R>, negated.)

=item solver

Kind of solver (C<-s>.)

For classification:

=over 4

=item 'L2R_LR' - L2-regularized logistic regression

=item 'L2R_L2LOSS_SVC_DUAL' - L2-regularized L2-loss SVC (dual problem)

=item 'L2R_L2LOSS_SVC' - L2-regularized L2-loss SVC (primal problem)

=item 'L2R_L1LOSS_SVC_DUAL' - L2-regularized L1-loss SVC (dual problem)

=item 'MCSVM_CS' - Crammer-Singer multi-class SVM

=item 'L1R_L2LOSS_SVC' - L1-regularized L2-loss SVC

=item 'L1R_LR' - L1-regularized logistic regression (primal problem)

=item 'L1R_LR_DUAL' -  L1-regularized logistic regression (dual problem)

=back

For regression:

=over 4

=item 'L2R_L2LOSS_SVR' - L2-regularized L2-loss SVR (primal problem)

=item 'L2R_L2LOSS_SVR_DUAL' - L2-regularized L2-loss SVR (dual problem)

=item 'L2R_L1LOSS_SVR_DUAL' - L2-regularized L1-loss SVR (dual problem)

=back

For outlier detection:

=over 4

=item 'ONECLASS_SVM' - One-class SVM

=back

=item weights

Weights to adjust the cost parameter of different classes (C<-wi>.)

For example,

  my $learner = Algorithm::LibLinear->new(
    weights => [
      +{ label => 1, weight => 0.5 },
      +{ label => 2, weight => 1 },
      +{ label => 3, weight => 0.5 },
    ],
  );

is giving a doubling weight for class 2. This means that samples belonging to class 2 have stronger effect than other samples belonging class 1 or 3 on learning.

This option is useful when the number of training samples of each class is not balanced.

=back

=head2 cross_validation(data_set => $data_set, num_folds => $num_folds)

Evaluates training parameter using N-fold cross validation method.
Given data set will be split into N parts. N-1 of them will be used as a training set and the rest 1 part will be used as a test set.
The evaluation iterates N times using each different part as a test set. Then average accuracy is returned as result.

=head2 find_cost_parameter(data_set => $data_set, num_folds => $num_folds [, initial => -1.0] [, update => 0])

Deprecated. Use C<find_parameters> instead.

Shorthand alias for C<find_parameters> only works on C<cost> parameter.
Notice that C<loss_sensitivity> is affected too when C<update> is set.

=head2 find_parameters(data_set => $data_set, num_folds => $num_folds [, initial_cost => -1.0] [, initial_loss_sensitivity => -1.0] [, update => 0])

Finds the best parameters by N-fold cross validation. If C<initial_cost> or C<initial_loss_sensitivity> is a negative, the value is automatically calculated.
Works only for 3 solvers: C<'L2R_LR'>, C<'L2R_L2LOSS_SVC'> and C<'L2R_L2LOSS_SVR'>. Error will be thrown for otherwise.

When C<update> is set true, the instance is updated to use the found parameters. This behaviour is disabled by default.

Return value is an ArrayRef containing 3 values: found C<cost>, found C<loss_sensitivity> (only if solver is C<'L2R_L2LOSS_SVR'>) and mean accuracy of cross validation with the found parameters.

=head2 train(data_set => $data_set)

Executes training and returns a trained L<Algorithm::LibLinear::Model> instance.
C<data_set> is same as the C<cross_validation>'s.
